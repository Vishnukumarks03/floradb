- nom parser isn't efficient as it looks. For an example for an input to be of  expression type across different enum variants. We need to check if it passes variants one by one.
- For extensibility, floradb is decided to build using trait objects than enums. Enums doesn't help in having all functions of a variant in single place, match statements explore for example check the polars codebase littered with enum types. Trait objects removes all such junk and helps to place all functions in one places of a variant.
